- Alerting workflow  
- Wazuh integration proposal  
- Centralised monitoring dashboard design  

---

###  10. Fully Authored GRC Tabletop Exercise Library  
Includes:
- Phishing → credential theft

##  Purpose of this Portfolio
This repository demonstrates hands-on experience with:
- Designing compliance solutions  
- Implementing TRA-based security controls  
- Closing PCI DSS 4.0 gaps  
- Conducting GRC investigations  
- Strengthening organisational security governance  
- Creating evidence auditors expect during assessments
