This repository presents a comprehensive collection of **professional Governance, Risk and Compliance artefacts**, developed across real GRC, security, and audit engagements.  
All documents have been fully anonymised and rewritten to ensure no proprietary or company-specific information is disclosed.

The portfolio demonstrates capability in building, operationalising, and maturing GRC functions within engineering-driven organisations.

#  Purpose of This Repository

This is an anonymised portfolio designed to demonstrate **senior GRC capability**, including:

- Designing and implementing scalable GRC frameworks  
- Closing PCI DSS 4.0 gaps with evidence  
- Executing deep-dive risk analyses (TRAs)  
- Running structured incident response programs  
- Building technical proof for auditors and stakeholders  
- Developing operational governance for software organisations  
- Designing security processes that work in real-life engineering environments
