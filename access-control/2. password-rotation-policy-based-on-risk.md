# Password Rotation Policy (Risk-Based)
## For System, Service, and Privileged Accounts

### Objective
Define password rotation intervals according to account privilege, exposure, and risk, aligned with best practices and Targeted Risk Analysis (TRA) outcomes.

---

## 1. Scope
Applies to:
- Privileged administrative accounts  
- Service accounts  
- Interactive accounts  
- System accounts used for automation or internal tooling  

Does **not** apply to end-user SSO accounts.

---

## 2. Rotation Intervals

| Account Type | Frequency | Basis |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Privileged accounts | Quarterly | High risk, broad access |
| Standard interactive accounts | Semi-annually | Moderate risk |
| Low-risk service accounts | Annually | Controlled environment, limited exposure |
| Incident-triggered resets | Immediate | Required by IR plan |

Rotations are automatically or manually executed depending on tooling.

## 3. Requirements

### **Password Complexity**
- Minimum 12 characters  
- Mix of: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters  
- No dictionary words or known compromised passwords  

### **Secure Storage**
- Store only within dedicated password vault (PAM)  
- No plaintext storage anywhere  

### **Rotation Enforcement**
- Automated through PAM where available  
- Manual rotation requires change control ticket  

### **Incident Trigger**
If credential compromise is suspected:
- Immediate forced rotation  
- Review of logs for misuse  
- Audit trail documented

## 4. Evidence Requirements
- Password change logs (PAM or OS-level)  
- Change management ticket  
- Verification by system owner  
- Reference to the TRA defining rotation frequency

## 5. References
- TRA: Password Rotation Frequency  
- Incident Response Playbook
