# Security Awareness Program Plan  
**XXXXX**

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Security Awareness Program
This program defines the organisation’s approach to training, educating, and raising awareness about information security risks.  
It is based on:

- NIST SP 800-16 (Information Technology Security Training Requirements)  
- NIST SP 800-50 (Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program)  

The goal is to reduce human-related security risks and embed security into organisational culture.

---

## 2. Scope
The program applies to:

- all employees  
- contractors  
- temporary workers  
- third-party vendors (as appropriate)  
- all organisational departments and business units  

Every staff member is responsible for understanding and applying basic security practices.

---

## 3. Program Considerations
Key considerations when designing and implementing the program:

- who manages and maintains the program  
- timeframe for completion (including new hires)  
- regulatory obligations and compliance requirements  
- frequency of training/testing  
- delivery methods (online, in-person, role-based)  
- target audiences  
- time constraints and operational impact  
- enforcement and consequences for non-compliance  

Training may include:

- instructor-led sessions  
- computer-based modules  
- quizzes and knowledge checks  
- phishing/social engineering testing  

---

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

### **Program Owner**
The designated IT/security lead is responsible for:

- developing and maintaining the program  
- coordinating training assignments  
- tracking participation and completion  
- recording training results  
- conducting tests (e.g., phishing exercises)  
- reporting completion metrics to leadership  

---

## 5. Awareness and Training Strategy

### **Annual Training Requirement**
All employees must complete security awareness training **annually**.  
New hires must complete training within **30 days** of onboarding.

### **Core Training Topics**
Training includes (at minimum):

- current threats and attack trends  
- data handling & protection  
- organisational security policies  
- privacy fundamentals  
- password hygiene  
- email safety  
- safe web browsing  
- mobile security  
- social media risks  
- wireless security  
- antivirus & endpoint protection  
- social engineering  
  - phishing  
  - vishing  
- physical security  
- how to identify and report incidents  

### **Additional Role-Based Training**
Role-based modules for specialised groups, including:

- IT/security teams  
- senior management  
- travellers  
- individuals handling regulated data  
- staff with elevated privileges  
- third-party service providers  

---

## 6. Training Metrics

Metrics include:

- % of staff completing training  
- number of reported phishing attempts  
- number of users who fell for simulated phishing tests  
- number of repeat offenders  
- behavioural improvements over time  

Assessment results may be used to adjust training content.

---

## 7. Training Records
Training records must:

- be stored in accordance with the organisation’s risk assessment requirements  
- be available to HR and compliance on request  
- include completions, attestations, quiz results, and testing participation  

---

## 8. Testing and Assessments

### **Social Engineering Testing**
Tests may include:

- phishing simulations  
- physical impersonation attempts  
- office walkthroughs to check for policy violations (e.g., unlocked screens, exposed documents)  

Results feed back into awareness training.

---

## 9. Non-Compliance
If an employee fails to complete mandatory training:

1. They are notified and given extra time (e.g., 2 weeks).  
2. If still incomplete — their manager is notified.  
3. Continued non-compliance may result in access restrictions or disciplinary action.  

---

## 10. Timeline (Example)

### Annual Training Plan

| Training | Audience | Frequency |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Security Awareness | All staff | Annually |
| Social Engineering Testing | All users | Bi-weekly / monthly |
| Incident Response Tabletop | IT / Security teams | Annually |
