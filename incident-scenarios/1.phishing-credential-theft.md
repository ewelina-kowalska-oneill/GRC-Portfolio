# Incident Response Scenario: Phishing Attack Leading to Credential Theft

## Overview
A realistic phishing attack targets an employee using a spoofed “security update” email that mimics a trusted service. The employee enters their credentials into a fake login portal, and an attacker gains access to their account.
