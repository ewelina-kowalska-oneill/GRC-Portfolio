# Incident Response Scenario: Unauthenticated Access to Internal API

## Overview
A newly deployed API endpoint was released without authentication controls due to a configuration oversight. The endpoint exposes customer metadata.

---

## Context
A partner engineer performing integration testing discovers a publicly accessible API endpoint that returns JSON responses containing customer metadata. This endpoint was introduced during a recent feature deployment.

---

## Injects

- Public endpoint responds without authentication  
- ~20,000 customer metadata records exposed  
- Audit reveals misconfiguration introduced during release  
- No monitoring alerts triggered for exposure  

---

## Expected Response Actions

### **Containment**
- Disable the affected endpoint  
- Implement missing authentication  
- Apply configuration scanning checks to CI/CD  

### **Assessment**
- Determine whether data constitutes regulated personal data  
- Identify if any external parties accessed the endpoint  
- Assess scope of exposure  

### **Remediation**
- Introduce API gateway authentication controls  
- Implement automated security checks in deployment pipeline

## Learning Objectives
- Validate release management workflows  
- Improve API security posture  
- Enhance automated misconfiguration detection
