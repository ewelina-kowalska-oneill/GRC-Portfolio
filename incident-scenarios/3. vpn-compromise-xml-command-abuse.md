# Incident Response Scenario: VPN Compromise & XML Command Abuse

## Overview
Attackers compromise VPN credentials and exploit internal maintenance tooling to repeatedly shut down servers via XML command interface.

---

## Context
A privileged employee’s VPN credentials are compromised externally (likely through credential stuffing or prior phishing). Once inside the network, the attacker triggers XML-based shutdown commands repeatedly, overwhelming the operations team.

---

## Injects

- Production server unexpectedly shuts down  
- Upon restoration, two more servers fail  
- Logs show XML shutdown commands issued from privileged account  
- VPN logs reveal login from foreign IP using legitimate credentials  
- SLA breach due to repeated outages  

---

## Expected Response Actions

### **Containment**
- Immediately block compromised VPN account  
- Rotate all privileged credentials associated with XML tool  
- Temporarily disable XML command interface  

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- Determine how credentials were compromised  
- Identify why multi-factor authentication did not prevent misuse  
- Review logging & alerting gaps  

### **Remediation**
- Implement MFA for VPN  
- Add rate-limiting & secondary verification for critical commands  
- Strengthen privileged access audit processes

## Learning Objectives
- Highlight importance of MFA  
- Assess privilege boundaries and tooling abuse risks  
- Validate operational readiness for repeated-impact incidents
