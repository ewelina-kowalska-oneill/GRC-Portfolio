# Incident Response Scenario: Third-Party SIEM Integration Failure

## Overview
A third-party security review reveals that a vendor’s SIEM integration is incomplete, resulting in missed alerts for several months.

---

## Context
During a routine assurance review, a discrepancy is detected between the logs expected to be forwarded from a vendor and what is actually appearing in the central SIEM. Only authentication logs are forwarded, while firewall, application, and API logs are missing.

This gap results in several past security-relevant events never triggering alerts.

---

## Injects

- Vendor’s quarterly report claims "no security incidents"  
- SIEM dashboards show missing log sources  
- Agents on vendor systems found disabled  
- Firewall logs reveal repeated failed logins that never raised alerts  
- Contractual requirement for full log forwarding was not met  

---

## Expected Response Actions

### **Immediate**
- Request full remediation plan from the vendor  
- Re-enable and validate all log forwarders  
- Perform a sample alert test to ensure integration is complete  

### **GRC / Vendor Management**
- Document third-party control failure  
- Update vendor risk score  
- Review contract for breach of obligations  
- Schedule follow-up verification  

### **Security**
- Review past logs locally on vendor systems  
- Identify missed incidents  
- Evaluate whether any correlated threats occurred unnoticed

## Learning Objectives
- Validate third-party monitoring requirements  
- Strengthen vendor oversight processes  
- Ensure SIEM dependencies are fully integrated
