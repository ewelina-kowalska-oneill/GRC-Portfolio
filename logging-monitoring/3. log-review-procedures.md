- Systems not reviewed daily  
- Backup servers  
- Jump hosts  
- Dev/Test environments  
- Reporting systems  
- Internal utility servers  

Daily-monitored security systems (SIEM, firewalls, IDS) are out of scope.

## 2. Review Frequency
Defined by Targeted Risk Analysis (TRA).

Examples:

2. Check for anomalous activity:
   - Repeated failed logins  
   - Unauthorised access attempts  
   - Unexpected configuration changes  
   - Log clearing attempts  
3. Document findings in Log Review Template  
4. Escalate any issues via service/incident ticket
