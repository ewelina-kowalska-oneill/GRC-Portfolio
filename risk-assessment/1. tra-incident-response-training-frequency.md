# Targeted Risk Analysis (TRA): Incident Response Training Frequency

## Objective
To determine the appropriate training frequency for the incident response team based on an annual assessment of:
- Emerging threats  
- Internal performance metrics  
- Organisational changes  
- Tooling/process updates  

This TRA supports a risk-based training schedule to ensure ongoing team readiness.

---

## Scope
All personnel assigned to incident response duties, including:
- Technical responders  
- GRC leads  
- Escalation contacts  
- Engineers participating in on-call rotations  

---

## Risk Factors Considered

### **1. Emerging Threat Landscape**
- Increase in sophisticated phishing  
- Growth of ransomware targeting SMEs  
- Supply chain attack patterns  

### **2. Incident Trends (Internal + Industry-Wide)**
- Recent incidents showing delayed containment  
- Industry peers reporting credential theft and misconfigurations  

### **3. Team Performance Metrics**
- Mean time to respond (MTTR)  
- Observed confusion or miscommunication during last tabletop  

### **4. Staff Turnover or Role Changes**
- Changes to IR on-call rotation  
- Internal reshuffling requiring retraining  

### **5. Tooling & Process Updates**
- Updated playbooks  
- New SIEM or logging workflows  
- Process changes requiring refresher training

## Risk Evaluation Summary

| Risk Area | Risk Level | Justification |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Threat evolution & complexity | High | Notable rise in phishing, ransomware, external threats |
| Internal incident missteps | Low | No major IR failures in past year |
| Staffing stability | Low | Team largely stable |
| Process/tool changes | Moderate | Updated processes and playbooks |

## Risk-Based Decision
**Recommended IR Training Frequency: Every 6 months (Semi-annually).**

### Rationale
- High external threat evolution requires frequent refreshers  
- Moderate internal changes warrant periodic retraining  
- Annual training is insufficient given current threat landscape  

---

## Evidence Requirements
- Completed TRA  
- Meeting notes discussing training frequency  
- Updated IR Plan referencing semi-annual schedule  
- IR training calendar for next 12 months
