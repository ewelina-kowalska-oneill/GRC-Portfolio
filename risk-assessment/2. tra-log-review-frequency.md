# Targeted Risk Analysis (TRA): Log Review Frequency for Non-Daily Systems

## Objective
Define and justify periodic log review intervals for systems not requiring daily review.  
Frequency is based on system function, risk, and potential impact of anomalies.

---

## Scope
Internal systems not classified as:
- Critical infrastructure  
- Security tools  
- High-risk production systems  

Includes:
- Backup servers  
- Jump hosts  
- Reporting tools  
- Utility servers  
- Dev/Test environments  

---

## Risk Criteria Considered

### **System Function**
- Business importance  
- Impact of downtime  

### **Data Sensitivity**
- CHD, PII, credentials, or non-sensitive data  

### **Access Type**
- Remote access increases risk  
- Local-only reduces risk  

### **Change Frequency**
- Frequently updated systems need higher scrutiny  

### **Threat Profile**
- Known historical issues  
- External exposure

## Log Review Frequency Matrix

| System Type | Risk | Frequency | Justification |
|-------------|------|-----------|----------------|
| Backup Servers | Medium | Weekly | Holds critical data; compromise impact high |
| Jump Hosts | Medium | Weekly | Admin access; lateral movement risk |
| Internal Reporting Tools | Low | Monthly | Read-only; internal-only |
| Dev/Test Systems | Low | Monthly | Controlled access |
| DNS/NTP Utility Servers | Low | Monthly | Low change rate; passive role |

## Evidence Requirements
- TRA document  
- Log review SOP  
- Sample log review reports  
- Escalation tickets if issues detected

## Decision
Approved log review frequencies as listed.  
Next review: 12 months from approval date.
