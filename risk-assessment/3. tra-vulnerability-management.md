# Targeted Risk Analysis (TRA): Vulnerability Management for Medium & Low Findings

## Objective
Define remediation timelines for medium and low-risk vulnerabilities, ensuring proportional response to potential impact while maintaining audit readiness.

---

## Scope
All internal/external systems scanned by the vulnerability management tool.  
Excludes critical or high-severity vulnerabilities (managed separately).

---

## Risk Factors Considered

### **Impact**
Medium and low vulnerabilities may lead to exploitation under specific conditions.

### **Likelihood**
Lower than critical findings, but increases if left unaddressed.

### **Asset Exposure**
Dependent on:
- Internet-facing vs internal  
- Lateral movement potential  

### **Exploitability**
Higher urgency for externally exposed assets.

### **Business Function**
Systems supporting financial processes may require faster remediation.

## Risk-Based Remediation Timelines

| Vulnerability Severity | Maximum Time to Remediate | Justification |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Medium | 90 days | Balances risk and dev/testing workload |
| Low | 180 days | Low likelihood; enables batching of fixes |
| Documented Exceptions | Case-by-case | Must include business justification & controls |

## Mitigation Lifecycle Requirements
1. **Detection**  
2. **Assignment**  
3. **Remediation or Risk Acceptance**  
4. **Verification Scan**  
5. **Evidence Retention (7 years)**  

---

## Evidence Requirements
- Scan reports  
- Tickets showing remediation  
- Verification scans  
- Risk acceptance forms (if applicable)
