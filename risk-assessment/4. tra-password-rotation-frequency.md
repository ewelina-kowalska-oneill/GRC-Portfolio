# Targeted Risk Analysis (TRA): Password Rotation Frequency for System Accounts

## Objective
Define rotation schedules for passwords and passphrases based on account privilege level, exposure, and potential impact.

---

## Scope
- Privileged accounts  
- Service accounts  
- Interactive and non-interactive accounts  
- System accounts with access to sensitive environments  

---

## Risk Factors Considered

### **Privilege Level**
Higher privilege = more frequent rotation.

### **System Exposure**
External-facing = high risk; isolated systems = low risk.

### **Likelihood of Compromise**
Credential stuffing & key leaks increasingly common.

### **Business Impact**
Service interruption vs security impact.

### **Existing Controls**
Password vaulting, MFA, PAM tooling.

## Rotation Frequency Matrix

| Account Type | Frequency | Justification |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| High-privilege accounts | Quarterly | High risk & potential blast radius |
| Standard interactive accounts | Semi-annually | Lower privilege but still sensitive |
| Low-risk service accounts | Annually | Minimal exposure, controlled environment |
| Rotations triggered by incidents | Immediate | Required if misuse suspected |

---

## Evidence Requirements
- TRA document  
- Internal password policy  
- PAM tool exports  
- Change tickets showing rotation completion  
- Incident-triggered rotation evidence
