# Targeted Risk Analysis (TRA): Systems Not at Risk for Malware

## Objective
Validate low-risk systems that do not require malware protection tools.  
Define evaluation frequency to ensure justification remains accurate.

---

## Scope
Systems classified as "not at risk" due to:
- Network isolation  
- Restrictive configurations  
- Limited functionality  
- No internet access  
- Non-executable environments  

---

## Risk Criteria Considered

### **Isolation Level**
Air-gapped or restricted VLANs.

### **Function**
Utility systems (DNS, NTP), network appliances.

### **Exposure**
No web browsing, no email, no external traffic.

### **Change Rate**
Systems rarely modified.

---

## Evaluation Frequency
**Every 12 months**, unless major changes trigger earlier review.

---

## Evidence Requirements
- System inventory list  
- TRA document describing justification  
- Completed evaluation reports  
- Management sign-off
