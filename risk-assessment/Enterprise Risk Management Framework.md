# Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework  
**XXXXX**

A structured approach to identifying, assessing, monitoring, and managing organisational risks across all business functions.

---

# 1. Overview

This framework defines how the organisation manages risks using:

- Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)  
- Risk taxonomy  
- Centralised risk register  
- 3 Lines of Defence model  
- Executive oversight  
- Risk appetite and key indicators  
- Incident escalation and reporting  

The board affirms that the organisation maintains adequate internal controls, governance mechanisms, and risk oversight.

---

# 2. Three Lines of Defence (3LOD)

The organisation uses the **Three Lines of Defence** governance model.

## 2.1 First Line of Defence — Business Functions

Responsibilities:

- Own and manage risks  
- Maintain effective controls  
- Identify risk events  
- Report incidents and losses  
- Provide data to support risk reporting  
- Ensure compliance with policies and procedures  

Examples: operations, engineering, IT, product teams, client services.

---

## 2.2 Second Line of Defence — Risk & Compliance

Responsibilities:

- Implement & maintain the risk framework  
- Risk identification, scoring, prioritisation  
- Maintain the risk register  
- Oversee incident/loss reporting  
- Monitor adherence to policies  
- Advise on risk implications of regulatory changes  
- Prepare risk reporting to committees  
- Ensure investment and operational limits are followed  

---

## 2.3 Third Line of Defence — Internal/External Audit

Responsibilities:

- Independent assurance of risk framework effectiveness  
- Challenge first and second line controls  
- Evaluate governance, risk, and compliance processes  
- Report findings to Audit & Risk Committees  

---

# 3. Risk Appetite

The organisation defines its **risk appetite** across all core risk categories.  
Risk appetite sets the bounds of acceptable risk and provides thresholds for escalation.

Risk appetite includes:

- qualitative statements  
- quantitative indicators  
- early warning indicators (EWIs)  
- hard limits (must not be breached)  

Monitored annually, reviewed by the Board/Executive.

**Risk categories include:**

- Strategic & business risk  
- Operational risk  
- Credit risk  
- Market risk  
- Information security & cyber risk  
- Legal & regulatory risk  
- Financial crime risk  
- Conduct risk  
- ESG & sustainability risk  
- Data & records management risk  

---

# 4. Risk Management Process (RCSA)

Risk assessment is performed through **Risk & Control Self-Assessments**.

Key activities:

1. Identify inherent risks  
2. Identify existing controls  
3. Assess control effectiveness  
4. Determine residual risk  
5. Record risks in the risk register  
6. Define remediation plans  
7. Monitor through KRIs and incidents  

Meetings with risk owners occur monthly to review changes in risk profile.
