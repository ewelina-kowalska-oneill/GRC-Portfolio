# Risk Assessment Framework  
**XXXXX**

This directory contains the organisation’s full risk management framework, aligned with ISO 27005, NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), and CRISC risk governance principles.

The purpose of this folder is to provide a **complete, auditable, and reusable risk assessment model** that demonstrates practical GRC capability for engineering-driven organisations.

#  How to Use This Folder

1. Start with `risk-scoring-methodology.md`  
2. Add risks to `risk-register-template.md`  
3. Establish governance boundaries with `risk-appetite-template.md`  
4. Monitor risk exposure using `kri-dashboard-example.md`
