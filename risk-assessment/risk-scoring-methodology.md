# Risk Scoring Methodology  
**XXXXX**

A standardised approach for quantifying risk exposure using likelihood and impact scoring.

---

# 1. Purpose
To ensure consistent, repeatable risk scoring across the organisation.

---

# 2. Likelihood Scale

| Likelihood | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Low** | Rare occurrence, no known incidents |
| **Medium** | Possible occurrence, some history |
| **High** | Likely to occur, recurring observations |

---

# 3. Impact Scale

| Impact Level | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Minimal** | Negligible operational impact |
| **Moderate** | Noticeable but manageable disruption |
| **Significant** | Major service impact, recovery required |
| **Critical** | Severe business impact, regulatory or reputational damage |

---

# 4. Scoring Matrix

Risk Level = **Likelihood × Impact**

| Likelihood ↓ / Impact → | Minimal | Moderate | Significant | Critical |
|--------------------------|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Low** | Low | Low | Medium | Medium |
| **Medium** | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| **High** | Medium | Medium | High | Critical |

---

# 5. Control Effectiveness

Controls rated on:

- **Strong** — reduces likelihood significantly  
- **Moderate** — reduces likelihood partially  
- **Weak** — little impact on risk reduction  

Residual risk calculated after controls applied.

---

# 6. Review Requirements

- All risks must be re-scored during quarterly review  
- After major incidents  
- After control changes  
- After organisational or technology changes
