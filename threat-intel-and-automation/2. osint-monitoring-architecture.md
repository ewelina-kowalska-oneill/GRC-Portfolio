# OSINT Monitoring Architecture  
### Multi-Tool Threat Intelligence & Leak Detection Framework

---

# 1. Purpose
Provide a centralised monitoring architecture capable of detecting leaked credentials, sensitive code, internal identifiers, and exposed misconfigurations across public and semi-public sources.

---

# 2. Architecture Overview

External Sources → OSINT Tools → Central Alerts → SIEM / Security Team


---

# 3. Data Sources Monitored

### Public Repositories
- GitHub  
- GitLab  
- Bitbucket  
- Public Gists  

### Paste Sites
- Pastebin  
- JustPaste.it  
- Ghostbin  
- Throwbin  

### Forums / Indexing Services
- Search engine caches  
- Public breach sites  
- Web archives  

### Optional: Dark Web
- via SpiderFoot modules

# 4. Components & Workflow

## **1. Data Collection Layer**
Tools:
- Google Custom Search API  
- SpiderFoot  
- PasteHunter  
- Shhgit  

Function:
- Collect URLs, content snapshots, metadata  
- Perform keyword & regex-based filtering  

---

## **2. Analysis Layer**
- Regex pattern matching  
- Keyword classification  
- Duplicate detection  
- Severity scoring  
- Threat categorisation (credential leak / code leak / data leak)  

---

## **3. Alerting Layer**
- Slack webhooks  
- Email  
- Webhooks to SIEM (Wazuh)  
- Dashboard alerts  

Alerts include:
- Source URL  
- Content snippet (sanitised)  
- Severity  
- Recommended IR actions  

---

## **4. SIEM / SOAR Integration**
Supports:
- Correlation with internal events  
- Automatic tagging  
- Escalation workflows  
- Evidence retention  

---

# 5. Scheduler Layer
Automation via cron:

### Example cron entries:

PasteHunter every 30 minutes

*/30 * * * * /opt/pastehunter/run.sh

SpiderFoot weekly scan

0 2 * * SUN spiderfoot -scan "Company Domain"

Shhgit continuous mode via systemd

systemctl start shhgit


---

# 6. GRC Integration

### Policies Impacted
- Incident Response  
- Third-Party Monitoring  
- Data Protection  
- Vulnerability / Threat Management  

### Required Evidence
- Weekly or monthly monitoring logs  
- Alert tickets  
- IR investigations  
- Documentation of false positives  
- Vendor notifications if third-party leaks detected  

---

# 7. Benefits
- Early detection of leaked secrets  
- Improved visibility into third-party exposures  
- Reduced time-to-detect (MTTD)  
- Strengthened compliance posture  
- High transparency for auditors  

---

# 8. Summary
This architecture demonstrates a mature, multi-layered OSINT capability built around automation, correlation, and audit-ready governance.

It highlights combined skills in:
- Security engineering  
- Threat intelligence  
- GRC & compliance  
- Monitoring architecture design  
- Third-party risk management
