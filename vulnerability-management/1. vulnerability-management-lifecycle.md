# Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Objective
Provide a structured, repeatable, evidence-driven process for identifying, assigning, remediating, validating, and documenting vulnerabilities across the organisation’s technology stack.

---

## 1. Scope
Applies to all:
- Servers  
- Applications  
- Cloud services  
- Network devices  
- Endpoints  
- Supporting infrastructure  

Covers internal and external vulnerability scans.

---

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Security / GRC | Manage scanning cadence, review findings, ensure compliance |
| System Owners | Remediate vulnerabilities for their systems |
| Engineering | Assist in patching/testing |
| Management | Approve exceptions, review remediation status |

---

## 3. Lifecycle Stages

### **Stage 1 — Detection**
- Automated scans conducted on defined frequency  
- Scan scope includes all in-scope systems  
- Failures or missing agents trigger immediate service tickets  

### **Stage 2 — Triage & Assignment**
- Security categorises vulnerabilities by severity  
- Assign to appropriate system owner  
- Add due dates based on TRA timelines  
- Create remediation tickets  
- Identify whether compensating controls exist  

### **Stage 3 — Remediation**
- Apply patch, configuration change, or mitigation  
- Document actions taken  
- Coordinate with Engineering for change control if required  

### **Stage 4 — Verification**
- Perform follow-up scan  
- Ensure vulnerability no longer appears  
- Attach evidence to original ticket  

### **Stage 5 — Risk Acceptance (if applicable)**
- Complete Risk Acceptance Form  
- Provide business justification  
- Define compensating controls & review date  
- Obtain management approval  

### **Stage 6 — Evidence Retention**
Store:
- Scans  
- Tickets  
- Risk acceptance forms  
- Verification results  
- Change control evidence  

Retention: **Minimum 7 years** (audit-aligned)
